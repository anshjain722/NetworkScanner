# Network Scanner

- This is a network scanner built in python

## v0.2

### **Done**

1. Divided code into different function
2. Added threading to make the code faster
3. Fixed some issues from version v0.1

## v0.1

### In this version we have the basic functionalities

1. Port scanning for a single device.

    - Port scanning for a network of devices.

2. Problems in this model

    - Shows some valid IP address as invalid **(Fixed)**
    - Very slow but I don't know if it can become better as it is wrote in python which is known for being slow.**(Fix in 2nd point in v0.2)**

## Future planning

- Port the whole program into rust to make it more secure
